Just stumbled out of the theater after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Borderline, and honestly, I’m not sure if I’ve been enlightened or if my brain’s been thrown into a woodchipper. What just happened? The 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮... it's like a sketchy deep dive into someone's trippy dream diary. I’m trying to mentally untangle it all — kinda like when you find that one clump of hair that magically knotted itself into a Gordian knot overnight.

This 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 has got more twists than a basket of over-cooked fusilli. And just like those leftover noodles you regret in the morning, there are moments you wish you could spit out. At times, I wanted to yell at the screen, like, Dude, who writes their dialogue in a blender?” But then there’s a scene that just hits you in the guts, and you’re sitting there thinking, maybe this chaos is the point. Or maybe I’m just as confused as the director wanted me to be.

> And the visuals—I've never seen so much neon since that ill-advised ‘80s disco night. Everything screamed something I wasn’t quite sure about, like an angry toddler demanding your attention but with zero communication skills. Kinda love-hate with it, like that hair color you were convinced was revolutionary but ended up chipping your self-esteem.

What's with the main character? One moment they’re like I can handle anything life throws my way, then next they’re unraveling like cheap extensions on a humid day. I mean, we've all been there, right? At the mercy of the universe’s whims. Or maybe just stuck on a loop like the damn buffering wheel when you try to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . 🤦‍♂️

function borderlineMadness(emotion) {
    return emotion ? 'More confusion' : 'Still confused';
}

Seriously, would I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again? Perhaps. If I ever decide I’ve had enough peace in my life and crave some old-fashioned existential whiplash. I’m annoyed yet intrigued, bewildered but curious. It’s everything you expect from a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 called Borderline — like when you try to cut a perfect bob and end up looking like a Picasso. Imperfect, but hey, still art, right?
